Tried to make a modern-ish design. The plan was to make it so you could pan between articles with the left and right buttons but couldn't figure it out. Might be easier if not done in react. Also tried using grid, was a lot more difficult than I expected but I made it work. Still not optimiized to react to different screen sizes but pretty happy with the project.
